How to apply akveo/ngx-admin template to your JHipster project. You should not use direcly.

When you generate a JHipster project it comes with default UI. You need to customize it.

#Why akveo/ngx-admin;
If you want to professional UI in your project it must provide same look and feel every on each and every one of components.
There are many compoenet sets out there which came with theme feature for same look and feel.
You can use them. But if you need to you 3rd party components it can be hard.
ngx-admin has already 3rd party components(echars,tree,maps) that you can see how to apply theme.
Thanks to the akveo team. They are doing great job.
