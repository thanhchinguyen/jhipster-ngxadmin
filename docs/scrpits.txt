git clone https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin.git;
cd ngx-admin;

Dependency merge;
We need to add dependencies to package.json from ngx-admin/package.json that is not exists.
Also you need to check version of dependency that is already exists. You can pick ngx-admin version if it is upper.

Copy ngx-admin ui-component files;
mkdir src/main/webapp/app/ngx-admin;
cp -R ../ngx-admin/src/app/* src/main/webapp/app/ngx-admin/

--switch bootstrap module to ngx-admin app.module in app.main.ts

-- overwrite index.html from ngx-admin
cp ../ngx-admin/src/index.html src/main/webapp/index.html 

tyring to build:
yarn webpack:build; get errors because added dependencies are not installed;
install added dependencies;
npm install;

yarn webpack:build; get errors "Cannot find name 'tinymce'."
ERROR in [at-loader] ./src/main/webapp/app/ngx-admin/@theme/components/tiny-mce/tiny-mce.component.ts:16:5 
    TS2304: Cannot find name 'tinymce'.

--To fix that copy typings.d.ts which has global definition of 'tinymce' and import it in app-module
Fix "Cannot find name 'tinymce'" error
cp ../ngx-admin/src/typings.d.ts src/main/webapp/app/ngx-admin/
and import it in app-module

yarn start;
-Now the application starts up but you will see error in concole of browser
ERROR Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot find module 'app/pages/pages.module'.
Because webpack cannot load string based module
To fix that ;

code replaced to remove string based routing by this commit.(There is angular-router-loader solution without touching code but it is not compatible now)
 

yarn webpack:build; get errors because assets files are absent
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '../../../../assets/images/square_pattern.svg' i
So copy the assets folder 
cp -R ../ngx-admin/src/assets ./src/main/webapp/app/ngx-admin/
and chage location in the code of rooms.component.scss  by this commit

And configure webpack/webpack.common.js to copy assets folder to web folder to be able to served from application

Now the app is starts up you can see someting different thwn ngx-admin since you did not apply theme. 


Location update for new assets folder in rooms component scss 

Add ngx-admin specific styles in to src/main/webapp/content/scss/vendor.scss

and import vendor.ts which imports extra style from vendor.scss into ngx-admin's app module
Now we can see ngx-admin page properly
But you see errors in browsers console so menus and some components are not working well

Echarts dependency install and compnent configs applied.
npm install echarts@3.7.2 --save;
